# archeoViz 1.1.1
Released: 2023-05-15

* Change in the 'location' menu: add a third option to visualise spatial uncertainty in the location of the objects (as lines, plans, volumes). Consequently, chage in the pssible values for the 'location' parameter ('exact.fuzzy' is replaced by 'show.uncertainty').
* In the 'Tables' tab, the types of spatial uncertainty can now be displayed in the tables.
* Bugs fixed: activating the immediate display of the refitting lines (with the parameters 'map.refits', 'sectionX.refits', 'sectionX.refits') failed and has been fixed.

# archeoViz 1.0.2
Released: 2023-05-04

* In the '3D plot', only the refitting lines related to the objects included in the data subset are displayed.
* Fixing issues in the generation of the R command in the 'reproducibility' tab.
* Add a table with details about the clicked point in the 'Map', 'Section X', and 'Section Y' tabs (using knitr::kable(), what adds a dependency to knitr).
* Add support for html in the tables displaying details about the clicked point.
* Add buttons to export the plots as html widgets in the 'Map', 'Section X', and 'Section Y' tabs.

# archeoViz 1.0.1

* In the '3D plot' tab, add a button to download the 3D plot widget as a .html file.
* Add 'Italian'/'it' as an option for the 'lang' parameter in the 'archeoViz()' function.
* Various fixes, concerning the squares labels, the display of the summary tables.
* Plot background is now adapted when using dark graphic themes (cyborg, darkly, slate).

# archeoViz 0.2.3

* square labels are not displayed if they do not correspond to the number of documented squares.
* add 'add.x.square.labels' and 'add.y.square.labels' parameters in the 'archeoViz()' function.
* add 'reverse.axis.values' parameter in the 'archeoViz()' function.
* add several parameters in the 'archeoViz()' function: square.size, reverse.axis.values, reverse.square.names, add.x.square.labels, add.y.square.labels, class.variable, class.values, location.mode, map.z.val, map.density, map.refits, plot3d.hulls, plot3d.surfaces, plot3d.refits, sectionX.x.val, sectionX.y.val, sectionX.refits, sectionY.x.val, sectionY.y.val, sectionY.refits, camera.center, camera.eye, run.plots.

# archeoViz 0.2.2
Released: 2023-01-10 (on CRAN)

* add 'default.group' parameter in the 'archeoViz()' function
* fix bugs in the display of the map

# archeoViz 0.2
Released: 2023-01-07

* Refits can be displayed in the X section, Y section, and Map plots.
* The 'objects' table can include an optional 'year' column, that is used to determine the timeline.
* The main features of the package are wrapped in functions and relative tests are included.
* Multiple checks of the data  are integrated.
* The display of optional features is now conditional to the availability of the related variables (the values of the location mode selector, the display of surfaces and refitting).
* It is possible to set whether the colors in 3D and 2D plots are determined by the layers or by an other variable.

# archeoViz 0.1
